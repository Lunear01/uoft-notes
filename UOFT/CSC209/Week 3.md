## C Language
- Input Streams and Output Streams
	- Input: Where the C program gets the data 
		- Defaults to the keyboard 
	- Output: Where the C program displays the data 
		- Defaults to the screen
	- Error output 
		- Error outputs 
	- ![[Pasted image 20260117175114.png]]
	- Input/Output redirection
		- ```bash
		  ./a.out < text.txt
		  ```
		- ```bash
		  ./a.out > text.text
		  ```
		- Can only read one file at a time
		- Feature of the OS, not C
- `fopen` and `fclose`
	- File manipulations in C
	- fopen: -r (read), -w (write), -a (append)
		- -w wipes the file before editing stuff
	- fclose: close the file being opened, return 0 if successful.
	- Example: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20260117180544.png]]
- `fgets`
	- Reads lines up to the defined maximum characters
	- Example usage
		- ![[Pasted image 20260117181142.png]]
		- Parameters
			- pointer to memory where text can be stored 
				- can be an array or a block of memory
				- returns the pointer if successful, returns NULL if error
			- `int n`
				- maximum number of characters that fgets is allowed to put in pointer 
			- The input stream
				- stdin, file path etc
			- NOTE: Always add `+1` to the maximum number, because it always includes an extra NULL at the end
			- 
- `fscanf` 
	- Same as scanf but it can have input stream from anywhere
	- Example usage: 
		- ![[Pasted image 20260117182302.png]]
		- parameters
			- file directory
			- formatting
				- `%80s %d`
					- Reads at most 80 strings first, stop at space
					- Read numbers 
			- check whether the name(the string array) and the &total(int) are being scanned (=2)
- Dynamic Memory
	- Allocating memory to heap
		- Heap retains memory until we explicitly tell it to free
		- `malloc(sizeof(int))`
			- Returns `void *` because it's only allocating space for the memory, doesn't care about the type. 
	- Stack memory is automatically freed after the function is executed
	- Memory leak is when you have memory on the heap that can no longer be accessed
		- Remember to free malloc space using `free`
			- `free(pointer_address)`
	- Dangling memory
		- Pointer that points to memory that has already been freed
- C Memory Model
	- Buffer
	- Code
	- Global Variables
	- Heap
	- Stack 
	- OS
- `strtol`
	- Covert strings to integers
		- Parameters
			- The pointer of the string 
			- The leftover of the string if any, otherwise NULL
			- The type of conversion
				- Base 10 
				- Base 64 
				- etc
- Reading arguments from terminal
	- ![[Pasted image 20260120201837.png]]
	- Header in main with 
		- `argc` indicating the total number of arguments inputted in the terminal
		- `**argv` indicating the argument itself
		- NOTE: `**argv` at 0 is always the program name
			- That means `argc` $\geq$  1

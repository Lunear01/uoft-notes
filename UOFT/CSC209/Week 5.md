### C Language 

### Files
- Writing to Files
	- The "w" means to write
	![[Pasted image 20260201174443.png]]
	- In this case, `fprintf` is used to output the print content into `output_file` the **stream**
	- ![[Pasted image 20260201174549.png]]
	- Use `fopen` to open the file and specific read or write mode through `"w"` or `"r"` parameter
	- Do any changes on them using `fprint` and set the output stream to the file pointer
	- Close the files with `fclose`
- Reading Binary files
	- Binary files is used because 
		- Less storage place 
		- Store files such as .mp3, .gif files that doesn't need it to be human readable
	- To open a binary file in C
		- `output_file = fopen("bin_file.mp3", "rb")`
			- `rb` stands for read binary
- Writing binary files
	- `fwrite`
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201180922.png]]
		- (pointer to the file/data want to be written (input data), size of each element, number of elements, file pointer to write
		- Returns the number of written element success, return 0 on error

- Reading binary files
	- `fread`
	- ![[Pasted image 20260201181819.png]]
	- (pointer of the file stored, size of one element, num of element, stream to read from)
	- Returns the number of read element success, return 0 on error

- All together modifying .wav files 
	- Reading binary files with `od`
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201183127.png]]
		- -A translates to base 10
		- -j skip the 44 bytes of the file (skipping headers/etcf)
		- -t the file consists of 2 byte values
		- The file
- Using `fwrite` and `fread` to modify/read/store structs is possible 
	- Same format different application
-  Moving around in a file
	- `fseek`
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201185843.png]] 
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201190027.png]]
		-  Changing pointer position to access different elements
	- `rewind`
		- Move to the beginning of a file

### Compiler
-  Frontend
	- Translates source code into language independent intermediate representation
	- Abstract syntax trees
- Middle end
	- Semantic analysis, make optimization to run faster
- Backend
	- Translates to assembly code 
- Header files
	- This is created to solve problems from having different source files having type mismatch when linking them together
		- The standard practice is to have different source files compiled separated and then link them together to optimize compilation in production
	- This is an interface, and intermediate layer 
		- Declare functions and parameters
	- Header file is later imported into the main function by
		- `#include "sorts.h"`
			- "" to tell the compiler that it's not a C library but a local file
	- `extern`
		- Externally define variables: abstract variables
	- `static`
		- makes the variable local to avoid duplicate variables
	- Guard conditions 
		- To avoid errors in defining multiple instances of the same error 
		- `#ifndef SORTS_H` 
			- Runs only when SORTS_H is NOT defined
		- `#end if // SORTS_H`
- Make files
	- Tracking dependencies
	- Make files: 
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201211113.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201211241.png]]
		- The white space before the recipe is a **TAB**
		-  It checks for any updates in dependencies and compile them 
			- If the file straight up does not exist, then it's going to compile the entire thing
			- If the file doesn't have any changes, it doesn't do anything
	- Sophisticated MAKE 
		- ![[Pasted image 20260201211538.png]]
		- It recursive solves dependencies by running the needed compilations
	- ![[Pasted image 20260201212229.png]]
	- `%.0: %` indicates that all object files depend on a header file `sorts.h`
	- `$<` the variable containing the first name of the list of dependencies
	- `$@` the variable containing the target
	- `.PHONY` indicates that it's not a file: lowkey like an alias
	- Can also define variables in a make file

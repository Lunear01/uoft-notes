### Devices
- Combinational circuits
- Multiplexer 
	- inputs and a select input to an output
	- inputs can be multiple bits long 
- Demultiplexer
	- Reverse mux
- Decoders 
	- Information converted into another format
	- Don't care values
		- Input not valid, output is not guaranteed
		- Can be used to our benefit
- Adders
	- Binary arithmetic and conversion
	- Hexadecimal numbers 
		- 0-9 
		- 10 is A 
		- 11 is B
		- 15 is F
	- Half adders
		- Adds two bites, produce two bit sum
		- Sum bit S and carry bit C
			- C can be implemented by `and` gate 
			- S can be implemented by `or` gate
	- Full adders 
		- Same as half adders but with an extra input `Z`
		- Can be chained together 
	- Reduction
		- Shrinks a multibit data into a single bit
- Ripple-Carry binary adder
- Subtractors 
	- Negative numbers can be represented as binary numbers 
		- Consider 11111111 + 00000001
			- All 0 except the carry on the 9th place, which returns 0, thus 11111111 must be -1
	- Signed vs unsigned
		- Unsigned all numbers a are positive
		- Signed all bits are used to store a 2's complement negative number
			- Half positive(including 0) and half negative
	- Two's complement (converting a given binary number into a negative)
		- Take one's complement
			- Flip the 0 to 1 and 1 into 0 
		- Then add one to the one's complement, giving two's complement
	- Rewriting subtractions into additions
- Comparators 
	- Using adder/subtractors to compare values

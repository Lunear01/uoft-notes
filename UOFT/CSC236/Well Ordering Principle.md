General Approach: 
1. Assume everything you can 
2. Take a look at what is trying to be proved
	- Negate that so you know the set $S$ is going to look like
3. Construct the set $S$ 
	- Show that it's a subset of the $\mathbb{N}$ 
	- Show that it's not empty
4. Apply WOP and state the there must be a minimum value such that it satisfies the statement in set $S$ 
	- $n'\in S$
5. Proof by contradiction
	- Assume the opposite of the statement wanted to proof
	- Make a connection with the assumptions made
	- Try to construct a value $n'-1\in S$ 
		- Somehow make it so that becomes an element in set $S$ to reach a contradiction: $$n'-1<n'$$
		- $\therefore n'-1$ is the smallest element in S, contradicting $n'$ being the minimum in $S$

## Operational Security
### Process of Opsec
1. Assets Identification
	- What are the important things I want to protect?
2. Threat Identification
	- What could go wrong? 
3. Vulnerability Identification
	- What can I do to avoid that from happening?
4. Access Control
	- Who do I give access to?
5. Monitoring
	- Making sure everything goes well and smoothly as desired.
6. Asset Management
	- Up to date inventory, what are the assets? 
		- Computers? Apps/Software? Data? 

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
- Disaster Recovery (DR)
	- Focuses on minimize disaster disruption and downtime, usually short-term mitigation. 
- Business Continuity (BC)
	- Broader, makes sure the operations goes on no matter what, for long term.

## Cloud Security
- Shared Responsibility Model
	- The cloud service provides operational security, but the user are responsible for their own unit's safety. Condo-resident analogy. 
- Data Breach
	- Unauthorized individual accesses sensitive data
- Misconfigured Cloud Storage
	- Improper settings expose data to the public unintentionally.
- Account Hijacking
	- User account credentials are stolen and impersonating the user, having full access. 
#### Key Areas of Cloud Security
1. Data Protection
	- Encrypting data at all times. Storing and transiting. 
2. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
	-  Ensures that only authorized individuals have access
3. Network Security
	- Ensures the network is well protected by firewalls and VPNs that protects data as it moves through the network. 
4. Compliance and Governance
	- Adhering to universal policies, following laws and adhering to modern industry standards in how data is stored and secured


## Physical Security
### Common Vulnerabilities
- Unsecured access points
- Weak locks
- Inadequate perimeter security 
	- Lack of fencing, barriers
- Poor Key Management
- Insufficient Lighting
	- Dark areas can incinerate criminal acts
- Exposed IT Infrastructure
	- Servers, network device, wiring closets that are physically accessible
- Lack of Visitor Management 
- Unattended Workstations
	- Computers/devices left unlocked in the public

## Mobile Security

### 4 Layers of Device Protection
- Device Security 
	- Passcodes, biometrics, remote wipe when device is lost, etc.
- Data Security 
	- Data encryption, backups
- Network Security
	- VPN
- Application Security
	- App permission management

## Internet of Things (IOT) Security
- Includes everything that connects to the internet 
	- Smart watches
	- Industrial sensors
	- Connected cars
- Ransomware
	- Encrypts user data and demand payment

## Social Engineering
- Phishing
	- Fake Emails
	- Fake Messages, phone calls, etc.
- Pretexting
	- Creation of a scenario to trick target to giving sensitive information
		- I'm the CEO of google asking for your Google password
- Baiting
	- Such as a pendrive you find in the parking lot that installs malware when you plug it in
- Tailgating
	- Follow after individuals opens the door, often with excuses such as holding a big box and can't reach the keys. 
- Quid Pro Quo
	- Offer benefit for information or access

## Insider Threat
- Malicious Insider
	- individuals with authorized access harms the organization intentionally
- Negligent Insider
	- Doesn't do it with a bad intention but do so through carelessness or lack of awareness. 
- Compromised Insider
	- External attackers gains access to insider credentials,  like usernames and passwords. Then, they operates as if they were legitimate users. 

## Advanced Persistent Threats
- Sophisticated and continuous cyberattack where intruder gains access to organization's network and remain undetected for an extended period.

## Principles of Information Security
### CIA Triad
- Confidentiality
	- Information only accessible for authorized authorities
	- Protect against unauthorized
	- Implemented by encryption
- Integrity
	- Maintains and assures data is accurate and complete 
	- Protects unauthorized modification
	- Implemented by hashing and digital signatures
- Availability:
	- Ensures information accessible to the authorized people
	- Protects against unauthorized access to the information 
	- Implemented by redundancy and disaster recovery planning

### Processes in Information Security
- Risk Assessment
	- identify potential risks
	- potential impact of breaches
	- prioritize security measures
- Security Planning
	- Strategies for identified risk
	- policies and procedures to guide 
	- allocate resources for this purpose
- Implementation of Security Controls
	- Plan into action
	- Deploying technical solutions
	- preventative and detective controls
- Monitoring and Detection
	- Watches for security events and anomalies
	- SIEM (System Information and Event Management) systems 
	- Identify security incidents 
- Incident Response
	- What to do against incidents 
	- Follow established procedures (playbook) to mitigate threats
	- Including isolation, eradication, recovery
- Disaster Recovery
	- Restoring after the incident
	- Implementing backups
	- Minimize downtime and loss
- Continuous Improvement 
	- Review and learn from incident
	- Update security measure based on new threats and tech
	- Involves regular security assessment and audits

### Tools in Information Security
- Firewall
	- Controls network flow
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems
	- Monitor and block suspicious activities
- SIEM Systems
	- Collect events and logs for analysis
- Vulnerability scanners
	- Identify weaknesses
- Access Control Systems
	- Manage user permission and authentication 
- Security awareness training platforms
	- Raise awareness in people.
- Virtual Private Network (VPN)
		- Service that masks user's real IP address and encrypts data.
